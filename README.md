# baremetal-programming
Welcome to my repository for embedded systems projects! This collection features a variety of bare-metal implementations and other embedded software designed for microcontrollers, particularly those in the STM32 family. Each project demonstrates different aspects of low-level programming, from UART communication to more complex peripheral management.
